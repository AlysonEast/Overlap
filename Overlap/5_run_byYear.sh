# Drive Overlap_CustomNulls_ByYear.R across every AUGMENT x YEAR x (LEVEL,POOL)
# pairing, concurrently, then average the two years for each pairing.
#
# Safe to parallelize: each run is an independent Rscript process that writes a
# uniquely named output (<LEVEL>_by_<POOL>_<aug|noaug>_<YEAR>_*Null.csv), so runs
# never collide -- they only share read-only inputs. The only limit is RAM/CPU,
# so concurrency is capped at $JOBS.
#
# Prereqs: run CalculateAbundance_ByYear.R once first (the per-year abundance
# files must exist), and apply the commandArgs / AUGMENT edits to both R scripts.
#
# Usage:  ./run_ByYear.sh                    # full grid, $JOBS at a time
#         JOBS=4 ./run_ByYear.sh             # cap concurrency at 4
#         AUGS="FALSE" ./run_ByYear.sh       # only the no-augmentation runs
